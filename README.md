Ideas: 
   How to maintain the mouse as a tool for movement through buffers while creating a GUI? 
      - using external controller 
      - using mouse keys to move through the gui HMM 
         - !!!! shift+mouse_move for when you u move through samples (eg shift and mouse movement)
            - it just sticks to where it is if you arent pressing down shift while moving the mouse 
      - TRY IT WITh QUNEO Rotaries
